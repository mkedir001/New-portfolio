			My name is Mohamedamin Kedir, however i often go by Amin as well. I recently picked up coding when i was forced into a situation where i had to create my own webpage. I am an entrepeneur at heart, but have a passion for coding and computer programming.

			After learning some basic HTML and CSS on my own, I found myself yearning to learn more. I started looking into some of the different programming languages and picked at it slowly. That is when i realized i wanted to dive into it head first, but needed a structured lesson plan, and before long, i found the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp
